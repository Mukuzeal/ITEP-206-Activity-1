# **Features & Functionalities**  
1. **Detect Letter Type (Vowel or Consonant)**  
   - Accepts a single letter input.  
   - Determines whether the letter is a vowel (`A, E, I, O, U`) or a consonant.  
   - Rejects invalid inputs and prompts the user to enter a valid letter.  

2. **Check if a Number is Odd or Even**  
   - Accepts a number input.  
   - Determines whether the number is **even** or **odd**.  
   - Ensures the input is a valid numeric value before processing.  

3. **Detect if a Character is a Special Character**  
   - Accepts a single character.  
   - Identifies whether it is a **special character** (e.g., `@, #, $, %`) or not.  
   - Ensures only one character is entered at a time.  

4. **Analyze a String (Combination of All)**  
   - Accepts a full string as input.  
   - Analyzes each character in the string and classifies it as:  
     - **Vowel** (if it's a vowel)  
     - **Consonant** (if it's a consonant)  
     - **Even/Odd Number** (if it's a digit)  
     - **Special Character** (if it's neither a letter nor a number)  
   - Provides a breakdown of the stringâ€™s composition.  

### **How It Works**  
- The program runs in a loop, presenting a **menu** for users to choose an option.  
- Users can select an option, provide input, and receive feedback.  
- If an invalid input is detected, an error message appears, prompting the user to try again.  
- Users can exit any feature or the program by typing **"exit"**.
